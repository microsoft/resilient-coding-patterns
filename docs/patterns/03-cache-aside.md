# Cache-Aside

## Overview
The cache-aside pattern is a widely used caching strategy that improves application performance and scalability by loading data into a cache only when necessary. The application is responsible for reading and writing data to the cache, ensuring that frequently accessed data is quickly available and reducing load on the underlying data store.

## Problem Statement
Querying a database or external data source for every request can lead to high latency and increased load, especially for frequently accessed data. Without caching, applications may experience performance bottlenecks and higher operational costs.

## Solution
With the cache-aside pattern, the application code first checks the cache for the requested data. If the data is not present (a cache miss), it retrieves the data from the underlying data store, stores it in the cache, and then returns it to the caller. Updates and invalidations are managed by the application as needed.

## When to Use
- When data is read frequently but updated less often
- To reduce load on databases or external services
- For improving response times for common queries

## Benefits
- Reduces latency for frequently accessed data
- Decreases load on the primary data store
- Scales easily with increased read traffic

## Code Samples: C#

**Before pattern implementation**
```csharp
public WeatherForecast GetForecast(string city)
{
    // Direct call with no caching
    return _database.GetWeatherForecast(city);
}
```

**Pattern implementation**
```csharp
public WeatherForecast GetForecastWithCache(string city)
{
    if (!_cache.TryGetValue(city, out WeatherForecast forecast))
    {
        forecast = _database.GetWeatherForecast(city);
        _cache.Set(city, forecast, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10));
    }
    return forecast;
}
```

## Code Examples: Python

**Before pattern implementation**
```python
def get_weather_forecast(city):
    # Direct call with no caching
    return db.get_weather_forecast(city)
```

**Pattern implementation**
```python
cache = {}

def get_weather_forecast(city):
    if city not in cache:
        cache[city] = db.get_weather_forecast(city)
    return cache[city]
```
