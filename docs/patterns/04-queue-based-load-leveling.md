# Queue-Based Load Leveling

## Overview
The queue-based load leveling pattern uses a queue as a buffer between a task producer and a task consumer to help smooth out intermittent heavy loads. This pattern helps applications remain responsive and reliable under variable or bursty workloads by decoupling the components that produce work from those that process it.

## Problem Statement
When a system receives bursts of requests, the backend or downstream services may become overwhelmed, leading to failures or degraded performance. Without a buffer, spikes in demand can cause resource exhaustion and instability.

## Solution
Introduce a queue between the producer and consumer. The producer adds requests to the queue as they arrive, and the consumer processes them at a rate it can handle. This decouples the rate of incoming requests from the rate at which they are processed, providing resilience and smoothing out load spikes.

## When to Use
- When backend services cannot scale instantly to handle spikes in demand
- To decouple producers and consumers for improved reliability
- When you need to absorb bursts and process work at a steady rate

## Benefits
- Prevents resource exhaustion by buffering requests
- Improves system reliability and responsiveness
- Enables independent scaling of producers and consumers

## Code Samples: C#

**Before pattern implementation**
```csharp
public void ProcessOrder(Order order)
{
    // Directly processes the order
    _orderProcessor.Process(order);
}
```

**Pattern implementation**
```csharp
public void EnqueueOrder(Order order)
{
    _orderQueue.Enqueue(order);
}

public void ProcessOrders()
{
    while (_orderQueue.TryDequeue(out var order))
    {
        _orderProcessor.Process(order);
    }
}
```

## Code Examples: Python

**Before pattern implementation**
```python
def process_order(order):
    # Directly processes the order
    order_processor.process(order)
```

**Pattern implementation**
```python
from queue import Queue

order_queue = Queue()

def enqueue_order(order):
    order_queue.put(order)

def process_orders():
    while not order_queue.empty():
        order = order_queue.get()
        order_processor.process(order)
```
